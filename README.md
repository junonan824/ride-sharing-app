# RideNow - Real-Time Ride-Sharing Application

RideNow is a real-time ride-sharing application built with MongoDB and Python. This application is designed to handle user data, trip data, and geolocation data for drivers and riders.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete users and trips
- Geospatial queries to find nearby drivers
- Aggregation to calculate average trip distances
- Real-time updates for ride status

### Conclusion

By following this guide, you will set up a powerful and efficient backend for your real-time ride-sharing application. MongoDB's flexibility and performance, combined with Python and Flask, provide a robust solution for handling dynamic and large-scale data. Don't forget to refer to the [official MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/) for more information and best practices.
